https://www.esri.com/en-us/disaster-response/disasters/wildfires
This is an up to date ESRI source that tells the public information about individual fires such as how many personel are working it, the current damage, conditions, etc.
You can use this to determine where the fire is, where it has been, and what type of action to take. Focusing on wildlife or humans is also a part as it states what amount of property
is on the area, how many people live there, and what wildlife could be impacted. I dont like how long it takes to load or do anything in the website, for an emergency response it should be quick
to load so that communication can be swift. I think cutting down on map clutter and not letting the map auto display would help. Selecting a map layer by state would alleviate the loading times.

THis is historical fire data sets that can be downloaded/viewed
It is an open source that can be used for a variety of cases like building/ prevention. This site doesnt load all of the data at once so it doesnt have loading errors until you zoom in. 
The site is a bit confusing as it has a lot of buttons and not much explanation.

https://esri-disasterresponse.hub.arcgis.com/pages/wildfires
This is a disaster response hub that links to other information for fire data.
It is public focused with links to other disaster response information. It has current data and historical data linked with fires like the Palisades fires.
I like this site because it is succint, clear, and informative.
